# **Employee Directory using Fetch API Request**
## *by Christine Treacy*
### Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 5

#### Description/Features: 
This app uses a single Fetch API request to return 12 random people. The user can click on one person to view a large version of their card. The Prev/Next buttons at the bottom will move to the last and next person, respectively. 
On the main page, type a name to filter/search by a particular employee's name.

### Built With:
# HTML
# CSS
# JS

### APIs:
[Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=12&nat=us) 

### CSS changes: 
So far I've added a background image, changed the background and size of the search button as well as changed the color scheme around a little bit. 

### Future Improvements:
I'd like to continue to improve the design of the app by exploring more fonts, CSS transitions, etc. I'd also like to add contact links for each employee and 'status' symbols for everyone to denote whether they are currently working at any given time.
